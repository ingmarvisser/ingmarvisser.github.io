After using Wordpress for the longest time I decided it was time to move my website to github with the main advantage that it will be much easier to include R code on webpages and in blog posts such as below. I mostly followed these sites when setting up:

-   <https://quarto.org/docs/websites/>

-   <https://samanthacsik.github.io/posts/2022-10-24-quarto-blogs/>

```{r}
1 + 1
```
